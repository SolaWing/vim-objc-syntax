# vim-objc-syntax
this is my objc syntax file, a better one than original one. 

In addition to original support, it highlights follow syntax:

- c function call
- objc method declare
- objc message call
- property Type
- superClass
- protocal
- instanceVar which begin with `_`
- dot chain property
- declared var's type
- some conventional naming const. such as:
    * word begin with k and a upper char
    * Notifications which begin with upper and end with **Notification**
    * const key begin with upper and end with **Key**
    * macro which consist all with upper char and _
